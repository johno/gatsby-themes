# Gatsby themes

> :warning: Please note that these themes are currently deemed unstable and can have breaking changes

A collection of themes using Gatsby's theming API and an experimental `gatsby-ui` library.

## Libraries

- `gatsby-ui`: Themeable UI primitives for Gatsby sites/themes

## Themes

- `gatsby-theme-blog-base`: Base theme that provides the necessary configuration and plugins for a basic blog
- `gatsby-theme-sideways`: Minimal blog theme for developers with a sideways footer for links
- `gatsby-theme-redirects`: Add a redirects manifest to your site to redirect legacy urls to their new location

## TODO

- document gatsby-ui
- favicon, maybe base it off accent color and dynamically link it?
- GatsbyLink-based component that ties active style into styled-system
