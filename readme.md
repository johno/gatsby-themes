# Gatsby themes

A collection of themes using Gatsby's theming API and an experimental `gatsby-ui` library.

## Libraries

## `gatsby-theme-minimal-blog`

A minimal blog theme for developers.
I built this theme for my personal website, <https://johno.com>, but anyone can use and modify however they'd like.

### Configuration

Option | Default | Description
--- | --- | ----
`name` | My Site | Your site name

### Customization

In order to customize the theme to your needs you can use component shadowing.

## `@johno/gatsby-theme-docs`

Turn your `docs` directory into a themeable docs site.
