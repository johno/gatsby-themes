# Theme

The majority of theming is defined in `src/theme.js` as a single JS object.
The theme is used by style functions from [styled-system][] to convert to CSS-in-JS (using [styled-components][]).

The theme consists of:

- color
- typography (size, weight, family, line heights)
- border radii
- box shadows
- widths
- space (margin and padding)
