# Box

Box is used as a child element of a flexbox layout, often wrapped by [`Flex`](/components/Flex).
It exposes a prop API for aligning itself amongst its siblings and other things like color and text alignment.

```js react-live
<Flex justifyContent='space-between'>
  <Box bg='grays.1' py={4} width={1/2} />
  <Box bg='grays.3' py={4} width={1/20} />
  <Box bg='grays.6' py={4} width={1/20} />
  <Box bg='grays.7' py={4} width={1/4} />
  <Box bg='grays.9' py={4} width={1/20} />
</Flex>
```
